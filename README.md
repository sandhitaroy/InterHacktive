### This is a simple educational website called "Go Education". It consists of the landing page and the payment/course enrollment page. In this website, a user can choose to enroll in several courses like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Users can sign up for it by filling up the details given at the bottom of the Landing Page. By clicking on "Start Learning!" given just below the description in the Landing Page, the user is redirected to the payment/course enrollment page. Here, the user can fill up their details, choose a course, select the payment method and finally enroll themselves for the course by clicking on "Pay Now". HTML and CSS were used for this project. A video of its working is attached below.
